Developed a BootCamp application that aims to anable the user to perform different activities , forexample 

Users come in 3 roles. Bootcampers(students), LFAs(Learning Facilitator Assistants) and LFs(Learning Facilitators). 
Bootcampers are scored daily on all our EPIC values based on their outputs and observed interactions with their teams. The scores range between -2 to 2 i.e (Very Unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied and Very Satisfied)
LFs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates in Bootcamp. They, however, can’t change any of the scores and neither can they add scores.
LFAs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates that are assigned to them during Bootcamp, add scores for them and edit only their candidate’s scores.
Bootcampers can only see the scores they have been given.
